Completion of course work

ABSTRACT

In this work I will address how to use trees with key and value to perform tasks of
information security, such as a simple blocking of folders in an Operating System,
trees are usually traversed with an index going to the other index, in my approach are
used index and value in building the tree, so I can execute tasks based on the
existing value, rather than an entire node.
